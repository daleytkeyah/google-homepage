This README is dedicated to the Google Homepage project
created by The Odin Project.
I literally have no idea what to do, but I hope it works out somehow.


From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

So for this project I basically had to copy another project just to see how it works really.

I learned that mostly HTML is written out first and then CSS can be used to tweak the HTML into the style that you need. A LOT OF IT can be considered trial and error and that's ok.

The last bit I had an issue with was the microphone icon. The user's project I was following along with had different measurements to get the icon into the search bar.

I also learned what a Z-index does and that is actually incredibly useful, else the search bar would be in front of the magnifying glass icon and the search bar.

I really liked seeing everything come together as I added more CSS elements to the page. My mouth was agape at creating the Sign in button. 

I actually get what the header and footer does and evereything just makes more sense. 

There is still a lot that I don't get, like why the user added a flex to the search bar and buttons, but I suppose I'll just keep learning.
